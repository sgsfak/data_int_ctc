The `Makefile` can be used to\r\nproduce various documentation of the analysis that exists in the `.pdf` files.\r\nYou need [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for that:\r\n    \r\n    make\r\n\r\nand also [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for creating the final pdf\r\nfiles (through Markdown).\r\n\r\nThe code exists in the `R` folder and in the \"source\" `.Rmd` files. We are\r\nusing the excellent [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) package for\r\ntransformation of the `Rmd` files to pdf. Therefore as the result of the `make`\r\ncommand a number of PDF files are produced -- one for each `Rmd` file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
