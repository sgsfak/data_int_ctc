## Data integration ##

This is a git repository for the code of our multi-platform data integration work for the  identification of biomarkers with relation to Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)

The R code can be found in the `R` directory. The `Makefile` can be used to produce various documentation of the analysis that exists in the `.pdf` files. You need [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for that:
    
    make

and also [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for creating the final pdf files (through Markdown).
